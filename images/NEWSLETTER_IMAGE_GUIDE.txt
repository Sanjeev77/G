HOW TO ADD YOUR IMAGE:
-----------------------
1. Download or create your image
2. Optimize it (use tinypng.com to compress)
3. Rename it to: newsletter-bg.jpg
4. Place it in: /images/ folder (same location as this file)
5. Refresh your website - the image will appear!


CURRENT CSS SETTINGS:
---------------------
• Image will cover the entire section
• Centered positioning
• Parallax scroll effect (fixed attachment)
• Purple/pink gradient overlay (85% opacity)
• Pattern overlay for texture


TO CHANGE IMAGE NAME:
---------------------
If you want to use a different filename:
1. Open: css/styles.css
2. Find line 431: background-image: url('../images/newsletter-bg.jpg');
3. Replace 'newsletter-bg.jpg' with your filename
4. Save and refresh


TO ADJUST OVERLAY DARKNESS:
---------------------------
If your image is too dark or too bright:
1. Open: css/styles.css
2. Find line 449: rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.85)
3. Change 0.85 to:
   - 0.7 for lighter overlay (more image visible)
   - 0.9 for darker overlay (better text contrast)


TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
-----------------------
• Choose images with empty space in the center for text
• Avoid busy patterns that compete with text
• Bright, colorful images work well with the overlay
• Test on mobile devices - image will scale
• Consider seasonal images you can rotate monthly

NEED HELP?
----------
The section will work fine with just the gradient until you add an image.
The purple gradient will show as the default background.
